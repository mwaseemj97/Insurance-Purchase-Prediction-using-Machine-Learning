Insurance Purchase Prediction using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project is a simple Machine Learning classification model that predicts whether a person will buy insurance based on their age. It demonstrates the basic workflow of a supervised learning model using a minimal feature set.

Problem Statement

To predict insurance purchase behavior (bought_insurance) using the feature:

Age

Dataset Features

age – Age of the individual

bought_insurance – Target variable (0 = Not Bought, 1 = Bought)

Machine Learning Approach

Data preprocessing

Train-test split

Model training using a classification algorithm

Prediction and evaluation

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib (for visualization, if used)

Model Objective

The goal of this model is to learn the relationship between age and insurance buying behavior, and accurately predict whether a new customer is likely to purchase insurance.
